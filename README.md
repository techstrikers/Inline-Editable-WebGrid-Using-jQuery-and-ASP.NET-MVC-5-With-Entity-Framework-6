# Inline-Editable-WebGrid-Using-jQuery-and-ASP.NET-MVC-5-With-Entity-Framework-6
In this article I am going to discuss how to create editable WebGrid which will provide you a functionality of inline editing using jQuery. Basically WebGrid does not have any built-in editing facility, but you can achive it using JQuery. The key idea behind this approach is to first populate the WebGrid with editable and read-only presentations of the data. And than, with the help of jQuery switch between the two presentations on a line-by-line basis.  http://www.techstrikers.com/Articles/mvccontrib-grid-with-razor-view-and-entity-framework6.php
